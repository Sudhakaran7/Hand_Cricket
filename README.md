Sudhakaran and Steev are bored in maths class so they decided to play handcricket,
Steev won the toss and chose to bat, he scored 21 runs in a over, now it is sudhakaran's turn to bat
he have to score more than 21 to runs to win, find who won the game.
There is only one over, each over contains 6 balls
Get the numbers in a array size less than six(the numbers should be below 6)
if the match ties, Print "TIE"
if sudhakaran able to score more than 21 without getting out, print "Sudhakaran Win!"
if sudhakaran not able to score then print "Steev Win!"

Sample input:
Sudhakaran's over:
2 3 5 1 6 6
Steev's over:
1 2 4 2 5 6

Sample output:
Steev Win!
